# WC
My first project. Console calculator with next actions (+-/*^, unary -) and "," and "()".
It's my first try to put my first project here. 
WC is Woodson's Calculator. My calculator probably is not so good as it should be. 
This is why it's name is WC (like a toilet you know :D).
Here I didn't use checking for correct input, because I will add UI. I'm planning make checking there.
